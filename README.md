# Programming Historian Scraping Workshop

This is a work in progress for the Programming Historian Scraping Workshop.

It's currently a copy of our previous workshop at Bard College ([repo](https://github.com/switcheristic-telecom/ehcn-scraping-workshop)).

## Install requirements

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup in VSCODE

Get the Python extension for Visual Studio Code. It will help you with the code completion and debugging.
